# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)  
According to the book “Moder Systems Analysis and Design” written by Joseph S. Valacich and Joe F. George, SDLC is a common methodology for systems development in many organizations; it features several phases that mark the progress of the systems analysis and design effort. The life cycle can be thought of as a circular process in which the end of the useful life of one system leads to the beginning of another project that will develop a new version or replace an existing system altogether. At first glance, the life cycle appears to be a sequentially ordered set of phases, but it is not. The specific steps and their sequence are meant to be adapted as required for a project, consistent with management approaches. For example, in any given SDLC phase, the project can return to an earlier phase if necessary. Similarly, if a commercial product does not perform well just after its introduction, it may be temporarily removed from the market and improved before being reintroduced. In the SDLC, it is also possible to complete some activities in one phase in parallel with some activities of another phase. Sometimes the life cycle is iterative; that is, phases are repeated as required until an acceptable system is found. Some people consider the life cycle to be a spiral, in which we constantly cycle through the phases at distinct levels of detail. However conceived, the systems development life cycle used in an organization is an orderly set of activities conducted and planned for each development project.  

## Why is SDLC important?  
Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and have a plan to achieve them.  

Here are some benefits of SDLC:  

- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved. 
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling. 
Improved risk management and cost estimation  
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction.

## How does SDLC work? 
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software. 

The details of the SDLC process vary for different teams. However, we outline some common SDLC phases below. 

### Plan: 
The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation. The development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document. The document sets expectations and defines common goals that aid in project planning. The team estimates costs, creates a schedule, and has a detailed plan to achieve their goals. 
### Design: 
In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. For example, they may consider integrating pre-existing modules, making technology choices, and identifying development tools. They will look at how to best integrate the new software into any existing IT infrastructure the organization may have. 
### Implement : 
In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result. 
### Test: 
The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs. Quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets customer requirements. Because many teams immediately test the code they write, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase. 

### Deploy:
When teams develop software, they code and test on a different copy of the software than the one that the users have access to. The software that customers use is called production, while other copies are said to be in the build environment or testing environment.Having separate build and production environments ensures that customers can continue to use the software even while it is being changed or upgraded. The deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation. 

### Maintain:

In the maintenance phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software. 

## What are SDLC models? 
A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We look at some popular SDLC models below. 

### Waterfall 

The waterfall model arranges all the phases sequentially so that each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase. Conceptually, the design flows from one phase down to the next, like that of a waterfall. 

#### Pros and cons 

The waterfall model provides discipline to project management and gives a tangible output at the end of each phase. However, there is little room for change once a phase is considered complete, as changes can affect the software's delivery time, cost, and quality. Therefore, the model is most suitable for small software development projects, where tasks are easy to arrange and manage and requirements can be pre-defined accurately. 

#### Iterative 

The iterative process suggests that teams begin software development with a small subset of requirements. Then, they iteratively enhance versions over time until the complete software is ready for production. The team produces a new software version at the end of each iteration. 

#### Pros and cons 

It’s easy to identify and manage risks, as requirements can change between iterations. However, repeated cycles could lead to scope change and underestimation of resources. 

#### Spiral 

The spiral model combines the iterative model's small repeated cycles with the waterfall model's linear sequential flow to prioritize risk analysis. You can use the spiral model to ensure software's gradual release and improvement by building prototypes at each phase. 

#### Pros and cons 
The spiral model is suitable for large and complex projects that require frequent changes. However, it can be expensive for smaller projects with a limited scope.
 

### Agile 

The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models. 

#### Pros and cons 

Rapid development cycles help teams identify and address issues in complex projects early on and before they become significant problems. They can also engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle. However, overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope changes or end the project midway. 

# LAMP STACK 

## What is a LAMP stack? 

A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today. 

## Why is a LAMP stack important?  

Web developers choose a LAMP stack to build web applications for the following reasons.  

- Cost : All LAMP technologies are open source, which means that any developer or company can use them without having to pay licensing fees. Instead of purchasing proprietary stack components, you can download the operating system, web server, database, and scripting language for free. This lowers the cost of building web applications. 

- Efficiency : Setting up a new web development stack requires rigorous testing of different frameworks, modules, libraries, and tools. On the other hand, a LAMP stack is a tried-and-tested web development solution. Web developers can prioritize and speed up application development to focus on what they are building instead of how they are building it. 

- Maintenance : Software experts from around the globe contribute to the development of LAMP stack technologies by changing, commenting on, and reviewing the publicly available source codes. They regularly maintain and update the technologies so that they remain relevant and secure.  

- Support : Popular open-source technologies, such as LAMP stacks, have the support of a large, global IT community. Hence, LAMP stack users can more easily find information on public IT forums. Web developers can refer to example codes or use tested plugins created by the open-source community.  

- Flexibility : A LAMP stack gives both reliability and flexibility to web developers. While the LAMP architecture specifies the software components for each layer, developers can replace them as they see fit. For example, they can use another operating system besides Linux as the stack foundation. 

## What is a LAMP stack used for? 

A LAMP stack is used for backend or server-side development. A backend application is software that runs in an environment that’s hidden from end users. Backend applications consist of the following: 

- Data processing software  

- Database components 

- Business logic in code  

### API for communicating with other applications  

The webpage that shows up on your browser is called the frontend application. When you interact with the page, such as by clicking on a button, your browser communicates with the backend application to retrieve the required information. 

Developers use a LAMP stack to create both static and dynamic web content. 

### Static webpages  

Static webpage information from the web server is the same for all users. For example, the address on a company's website is static content. Web developers create static webpages with HTML and CSS programming languages and store them as files in the web server application.  

### Dynamic webpages  

Dynamic webpages contain information that changes depending on the user viewing the webpage or web application. For example, a website message that changes based on your location is dynamic content. The web server delivers dynamic websites by processing business logic or retrieving data from a database. 

  

## What is the LAMP architecture?  

A software stack is a set of layered tools, libraries, programming languages, and technologies used for building, managing, and running an application. The stack consists of software components that support the application in different ways, such as visual presentation, database, networking, and security.  

Similarly, the LAMP architecture consists of four software technologies that work together behind the scenes to create a working web application. It describes how each of these web development technologies interact with each other in a computer server. The LAMP architecture consists of the following layers. 

### Linux 

Linux is an open-source operating system that you can install and configure to meet different application requirements. Linux sits at the first level of the LAMP stack and supports other components on the upper layers. 

### Apache 

Apache is an open-source web server that forms the second layer of the LAMP stack. The Apache module stores website files and exchanges information with a browser using HTTP, an internet protocol for transferring website information in plain text. For example, when a browser requests a webpage, the Apache HTTP server does the following: 

### Receives the request 

Processes the request and finds the required page file 

Sends the relevant information back to the browser 

### MySQL 

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system and is the third layer of the LAMP stack. The LAMP model uses MySQL for storing, managing, and querying information in relational databases. For example, developers store application data, such as customer records, sales, and inventories. When a user searches for information, the web server queries the stored data in MySQL. Query refers to special instructions for manipulating data in a relational database with the SQL language. 

### PHP 

PHP, which stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, is the fourth and final layer of the LAMP stack. It is a scripting language that allows websites to run dynamic processes. A dynamic process involves information in software that constantly changes. Web developers embed the PHP programming language in HTML to show real-time or updated information on websites. They use PHP to allow the web server, database, and operating system to cohesively process requests from browsers.  

### HTML compared to PHP 

Web developers use HTML for frontend development, such as designing the layout of webpages. Meanwhile, they use PHP to determine the behavior of certain components when users load a webpage. For example, web developers design the graphical layout of an online product catalog with HTML. They then use PHP code to retrieve the latest product price from the backend server. 

## How does a LAMP stack work?  

Web applications use a LAMP stack to respond to requests from web browsers. The Apache web server and MySQL database run on the Linux operating system and communicate using PHP. When you open a webpage in a browser, the LAMP stack goes through the following process. 

- Receives requests : The Apache web server receives the incoming request from the browser. If the request is to load a static file, the Apache server responds directly with the appropriate content. If the request is for dynamic content, the Apache server passes the request to the PHP component. The PHP component finds and loads the appropriate PHP file that can process the request. 

- Processes requests : The PHP file contains PHP functions that are codes for generating dynamic content. The PHP component processes the PHP functions, such as converting measurement units or creating a sales chart. Some PHP functions might require information from the database. In such cases, the PHP code retrieves the stored information from the database and uses it to process the function.  

- Returns responses : The PHP passes the calculated results to the web server in HTML format. At the same time, it also stores new data in the MySQL database. The Apache HTTP server sends the dynamic HTML results to the user's browser.  

## What are LAMP alternatives? 

LAMP alternatives, or LAMP variants, are backend development technologies that use different components than those specified in the LAMP architecture. For example, web developers might use other web servers instead of Apache to receive and process requests from frontend applications. Some LAMP alternatives might use proprietary components, such as licensed operating systems.  

### Alternative scripting languages 

While PHP is the default scripting language of the LAMP stack, developers can replace it with Perl or Python.  

- Perl : Perl is a programming language that has been around for more than 30 years. Developers use Perl for web development because it works well with database integration and has frameworks that help with development. Frameworks are software tools that contain well-tested components that speed up application development. 

- Python : Python is a high-level programming language for building different types of software, including web applications. Developers use Python in web development because it’s simple and easy to understand. 

# chown vs. chmod Linux Commands
The chmod and chown Linux commands are the main tools used for controlling file permissions in Linux. They both go hand in hand, and must be used in conjunction to effectively control which users have the ability to use certain files.

There are three main permissions in Linux:
- Read – the ability to open a file and read its contents
- Write – the ability to edit and save changes to files
- Execute – the ability to execute a file, such as a Bash script

These three types of permissions can then be delegated to three different user types:
- Owner – the user or owner of the file
- Group – a user group that has permissions on the file
- Other – all other users that are neither the owner nor in the group

**Let’s say we have the following file:**
`$ ls -l test_file.txt -rwxrw-r-- 1 linuxconfig admins 4 May 2 18:00 test_file.txt`

The output tells us that:

- The owner of the file is linuxconfig, with read, write, and execute permissions
- The group of the file is admins, with read and write permissions
- All other users only have read permissions on the file

## How to use chown

In order to assign permissions to individual users, or a group of users, we first need to use the chown command to specify who the owner and group of the file should be. Once we have these settings applied, then we can edit the owner and group permissions with chmod.

**Let’s start by setting the owner of file test_file.txt to user linuxconfig:**
`$ sudo chown linuxconfig:linuxconfig test_file.txt`
Note that we used the sudo command here, which is necessary for changing file ownership. We also used the linuxconfig:linuxconfig syntax to change both the user and group simultaneously. This is effectively the same as giving no group permissions, since the linuxconfig group only contains one user – linuxconfig.

**Or if we want to configure both the owner linuxconfig and group admins we can execute:**
`$ sudo chown linuxconfig:admins test_file.txt`
The chgrp command can be used if you only want to change the group for a file, and not the owner. 

**In this example we change the group to admins:**
`$ sudo chgrp admins test_file.txt`

## How to use chmod

Now that we have the owner and group set correctly, we can use the chmod command to modify the file permissions we need for the owner, group, and other users.

The chmod command can accept many syntaxes and options, and it would be out of the scope of this tutorial to cover them all. Instead, see our chmod command tutorial for a list of various examples. In this section, we will just cover the basics in order to help you understand how the chmod is different from chown.

**The following command will change permissions for the owner, group, and other users:**

`$ chmod 760 test_file.txt`
- The 7 is equivalent to read, write, and execute permissions, and will grant these permissions to the owner
- The 6 is equivalent to read and write permissions, and will grant them to the group
- The 0 is equivalent to no permissions, and assigns them to all other users

In this way, we can see how the chown and chmod commands complement each other to achieve the permissions that we need for each file. The chmod command controls permissions for all users, and the chown command allows us to assign permissions in a more granular way by configuring the owner and group accounts.
